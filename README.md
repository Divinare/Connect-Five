# Tictactoe | React Native project

## Prerequisites

Install React Native dependencies on your machine: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Start the project

Run the metro server
```
yarn start
```

Run on Android
```
yarn android
```

Run on iOS
```
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
